<h1 id="runningtheproject">Running the Project</h1>

<p>To run the project you must run both the front end and the back end server. To start the front end simply use <code>npm start</code> and in a separate terminal use <code>npm run dev</code> for the back end. This is a simple baking focused clone of Reddit functionality. The project is still in active development.</p>
